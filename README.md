# Helpjuice Chunin Exam

Welcome to the Helpjuice code challenge solution. This repository was forked and then cloned.  The following changes are made to 'development' branch and is being submitted for review.

## Context

[Helpjuice](https://www.helpjuice.com/) provides a reasonable overview and description of who are we and what we do.



## Tasks

### 1. Build a URL shoretner app

A URL shortener is an online application that converts a regular URL into its condensed format.

The user only has to copy the full URL of a website and paste it into the URL shortening tool to come up with an abbreviated version that is around 10 to 20 characters long.

Example:

Regular URL - http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/09/us/more-casinos-and-internet-gambling-threaten-shakopee-tribe.html?_r=1&hp

Shortened URL - http://`your-domain`/P7eg6B

Shortened URL then redirects to the original URL.

**This task is completed and the repo functions as expected.  A little bit of statistics included.  Bootstrap is added for a better look**

### 2. Stimulus

Stimulus is added to rails to show off some of that JavaScript magic.

Cliboard_controller is used and the relevant attributes added in the views and a copy button is provided to copy the shortened url to system clipboard.

Installed and configured Rspec and and tested the code with several tests.


### 4. Write documentation

Documentation included.
